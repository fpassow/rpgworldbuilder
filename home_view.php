<h1>RPG World Builder</h1>

<p>This is a tool for turning ideas into fun, playable RPG campaigns.</p>

<p>It isn't about rules. We have rules. You can use GURPS, or Fate, or D20. If your idea is fantasy,
use rules from your favorite fantasy game. If your idea is science fiction, try rules from
your favorite science fiction game. Rules are not a problem.</p>

<p>The question is, will an idea <i>work</i>? Will it support adventures which are easy
to write and fun to run?</p>

<p>And to answer that question, and to help <i>make</i> it work, I've collected and
organized some things that have worked in the past, and built them into this tool.</p>
